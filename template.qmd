\noindent This Quarto template is unofficial and based on Overleaf's APSR template. The first sentence of the article should not be indented, so keep the above command. Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Since we are in Quarto, you can cite with an `@` symbol, like @knuth1984texbook. As seen below, you can mix markdown and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.
